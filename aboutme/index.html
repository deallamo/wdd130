    <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
    <p>Hi! My name is Dea Angela Miole Llamo, 28 years old, currently residing in the Philippines.I am married and we're preparing to be
        sealed in the temple this coming June! I am a parent to a four-legged hooman who just turned two years today. I am very much looking
        forward to be a real Mom soon when the blessing comes.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Education and Career</h3>
    <p>I am pursuing a degree in Applied Technology focused on Software Development under BYU-Idaho, BYU Pathway Worldwide Program.
        This will be my second bachelor's degree. I earned my Business Degree majored in Human Resource Development and Management
        in a local university in 2016.

        Many people are telling me why I didn't I pursue a Masters Degree in Business instead rather than pursuing a second course that
        is entirely different from first degree. My reason is because I want to be equipped with the fundamental knowledge and skills in the future.
        With the current boom of AI in our times, I am expecting that many jobs with be replaced by this artificial intelligence. This is my way to
        secure my source or provision for my family's temporal needs. Or perhaps, someday, I could own a tech company, if opportunity allows.
    </p>

    <p>I aim to pursue an MBA after I graduate here.</p>

    <p>I work full-time as a Customer Success Manager in an Australian-based company that allows me to work remotely. I have discovered
        that I have a knack for workflows, process documentation and process improvement so I am currently transitioning to be part of our
        Research and Process Team. This will be my third department in this company in a year! But prior that, I have worked as an HR Business Partner 
        for six years.
