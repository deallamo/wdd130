                <h2>Meet the Multitasking Maven!</h2>
                <p>As a 28-year-old wife and proud mom of a two-year-old four-legged "hooman," I've mastered the art of balancing it all. When not tackling 
                    life's demands, I find solace in retail therapy and indulging in delectable cuisine. </p>
                <p>Weekends transform into thrilling adventures with medical dramas, anime marathons, and epic mobile gaming sessions alongside my husband. 
                    And when we crave excitement, we hit the open road on our motorcycles. But that's not all — I also unleash my inner diva at karaoke sessions. </p>
                <p>Currently, I'm pursuing my passion for Software Development through Brigham Young University's BYU-Pathway Worldwide program. I am also serving
                    as a Service Missionary for BYU-Pathway.</p>
