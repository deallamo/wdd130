        Hey, I'm Dea — an HR Generalist with proven expertise and a passion for enhancing processes and workflows.

        With seven years of experience as a Human Resources Generalist in the outsourcing/offshoring industry, I bring a proven track record 
        of success in various HR domains. From Employee Relations and Engagement to Event Planning and Management, I have honed my skills to deliver 
        exceptional results. Moreover, my expertise extends beyond HR, encompassing client services, operational support, and process improvement.
        
        In my current role as a Customer Success Manager, I not only excel in ensuring customer satisfaction but also take charge of projects focused 
        on process improvement and workflow design and documentation. I consistently uphold labor compliance standards, guaranteeing that all executed 
        processes align with legal requirements.
        
        With my comprehensive HR background and growing proficiency in process improvement, I am poised to make a significant impact in streamlining 
        operations, optimizing efficiencies, and driving organizational success. Let's connect to explore how I can contribute to your team's growth 
        and success.</p>

      <p>About Me
        Meet the multitasking maven! As a 28-year-old wife and proud mom of a two-year-old four-legged "hooman," I've mastered the art of balancing it all. 
        When not tackling life's demands, I find solace in retail therapy and indulging in delectable cuisine. Weekends transform into thrilling adventures 
        with medical dramas, anime marathons, and epic mobile gaming sessions alongside my husband. And when we crave excitement, we hit the open road on our 
        motorcycles. But that's not all — I also unleash my inner diva at karaoke sessions. 
        
        Currently, I'm pursuing my passion for Software Development through Brigham Young University's BYU-Pathway Worldwide program.</p>
