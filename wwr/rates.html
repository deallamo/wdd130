                        <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
                        <p>The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the number of 
                            folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left. Herds of elk and deer 
                            graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted. </p>
                        <p>The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. 
                            As a free-flowing river, the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late
                            summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, 
                            warmer water more.</p>

                        <h2>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
                        <p>Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the 
                            canyon tells. Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards 
                            the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous.</p>
                        <p>Desolation is rated Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days. This 84-mile trip runs from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid 
                            (just outside Green River, Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic
                            human activity, and great whitewater opportunities. </p>
                        <h3>Desolation 6-Night Trip</h3>
                        <p>Regular Rate: $1,790</p>
                        <p>Trip Dates: July 10, 18, 26 | Aug 3, 11, 19, 27 | Sept 4</p>

                        <h2>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
                        <p>Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience. 
                            The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids but also with side canyons and ancient Indian ruins accessible only by 
                            the river.</p>
                        <p>The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X (1 - 10) to accommodate such 
                            a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we 
                            often refer to both.</p>
