                        <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
                        <p>The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the number of 
                            folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left. Herds of elk and deer 
                            graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted. </p>
                        <p>The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. 
                            As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late
                            summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, 
                            warmer water more.</p>
                        <h3>Salmon River 5-Night Trip</h3>
                        <p>Regular Rate: $1,540</p>
                        <p>Trip Dates: June 3, 10, 17, 24 and July 2</p>

                        <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
                        <p>Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the 
                            canyon tells. Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards 
                            the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous.</p>
                        <p>Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid 
                            (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic
                            human activity, and great whitewater opportunities. </p>

                    <h2>More Than Just The Thrill</h2>
                    <p>Enjoy the breathtaking scenery. From valleys, meadows, canyons, and high peaks; it's way more than just the rapids. It's a great way to get away from it all and relax amongst all the beauty of the great outdoors. </p>
